  <h3>Use S.M.A.R.T Principles When writing the BCF FPR</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          S - Specific - Well defined. Clear to anyone that has a basic knowledge of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          M - Measurable - Know if the goal is obtainable. Find out when you have achieved your goal<
        </p>
        <p>
          A - Agreed Upon - Agreement with all the stakeholders what the goals should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          R - Realistic - Within the availability of resources, knowledge and time.
        </p>
        <p>
          T - Time-bound - Enough time to achieve the goal. Not too much time, which can affect project performance

        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li>A completed FPR must be included as to a project's github repo as the first commit/PR as an md file. This will help guide the project, and anyone who joins it can quickly find out the most important information.
          </li>
          <li>Any print media the BCF funds with either dimension over 40mm must have the BCF round logo on it somewhere.
          </li>
          <li>Any print media the BCF funds with either dimension over 100mm must have the logos of our Tier 3 sponsors on it somewhere.</li>
          <li>Any video projects the BCF funds must include the BCF Bitcoin Cash animation at the beginning or end of the video.
          </li>

          </li>

        <h3>What isn't the Bitcoin Cash Fund for.</h3>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Funds will not be given to companies just to further their business. Companies are welcome to submit an FPR as long as it is for a specific project that attempts to directly increase awareness and adoption of Bitcoin Cash.
          </li>
          <li>
            Funds will not be paid to individuals or businesses simply because they want money.
          </li>
          <li>
            Funds will not be paid for BCH protocol development (at this time).
          </li>
        </ul>
